\chapter{Agent Based Model}
\label{ch:abm}

The final task of the thesis is to develop an agent-based model (ABM) that reproduces the repeated interactions of individuals according to the relations found in the data. This ABM would allow us to not only verify any control strategies found in the preceding analysis but also validate our SynTG algorithm.
